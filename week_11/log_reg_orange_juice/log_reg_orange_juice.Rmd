You have been provided with a set of data on customer purchases of either ‘Citrus Hill’ (purchase = 'CH') or ‘Minute Maid’ (purchase = 'MM') orange juice, together with some further attributes of both the customer and the store of purchase. A data dictionary is also provided in the data directory.

We would like you to build the best predictive classifier you can of whether a customer is likely to buy Citrus Hill or Minute Maid juice. Use logistic regression to do this. You should use either train-test splitting or cross-validation to evaluate your classifier. The metric for ‘best classifier’ will be highest AUC value either in the test set (for train-test splitting) or from cross-validation.

Issues we faced, thoughts we had

This is quite a tough, open-ended exercise. We decided early on to use an automated approach to model selection using glmulti(), but feel free to use a manual approach if you prefer!
The Purchase dependent variable will require wrangling to work in logistic regression. We replaced it with a purchase_mm logical variable.
Wrangle other categorical variables to be factors too.
WeekOfPurchase is also quite tough to deal with: should it be added as a factor variable (it will lead to many coefficients), left as numeric, or omitted entirely? See if you can come up with a strategy to decide what to do with it.
Check for aliased variables and remove any aliases before you set off to find your best models. Remember, you can use something like alias(purchase_mm ~ ., data = oj) to do this, the dot . here means ‘all variables’. Aliased variables will be listed down the left-hand side, and you can subsequently remove them.
