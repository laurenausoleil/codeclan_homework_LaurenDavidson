# Get data and best model
```{r}
avacado <- read_csv("data/clean_avocado.csv")

model <- lm(average_price ~ type + region, data = avocado)
```


# K fold test

Set 10 folds
```{r}
cv_10_fold <- trainControl(method = "cv", number = 10, savePredictions = TRUE)
```

Test model
```{r}
k_fold_test <- train(
  average_price ~ type + region,
  data = avacado,
  trControl = cv_10_fold,
  method = "lm"
)
```

Residual score for the model
```{r}
mean(k_fold_test$resample$RMSE)
```
Average error of 0.271 across 10 folds

```{r}
mean(k_fold_test$resample$Rsquared)
```
Average R Sqaured of 0.54, our model predicts about 50% of the variance in average avocado price.
