#2.1 Adding colour
#Make the colour of the bars depend on the type of medal thatâ€™s being compared.
#
#Hint
#2.2 A whole new app
#Can you build a new app that explores the data in a different way? Perhaps using a #different type of plot. Look at the widget gallery and try out different widget types #too.
