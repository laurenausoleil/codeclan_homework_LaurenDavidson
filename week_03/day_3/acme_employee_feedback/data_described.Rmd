The Acme Database I am working on has 3 tables: employees, feedbacks and teams.

### How many records are there in each table?
Employees - 200
Feedbacks - 60
Teams - 11

### Are there any constraints on foreign keys?
Employee ID in feedback cannot be null.
Team ID in employees cannot be null.

### Can you summarise any relationships between tables?
Employees relates to Feedbacks via the employee ID
e.id = f.employee_id

Employees relates to teams via team ID
e.team_id = teams.id
